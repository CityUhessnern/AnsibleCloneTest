# AnsibleCloneTest
This is to test cloning a repository using Ansible.

If you see this file in your target directory, congratulations! It worked!

# AnsibleCommitTest

Honestly, I'm not sure what I should see if there is a commit that I haven't pushed, but I'll check. 

Does it still work without secrets.yml?

#GitFetchTest

Does this show up if I fetch it?
